# Flixage
Music service project using Spring Boot, heavily inspired by Spotify. This is my first attempt to use microservice architecture. 
Project contains 8 modules, the frontend made in Flutter, docker-compose ready for local development and a database schema.

1. **core** - domain exceptions, common configurations for every sub project.
2. **core-authentication** - contains classes that are needed to provide authentication for Admin users to microservice (Eureka, Gateway, Actuator)
3. **core-resource** - core resource logic shared between **service-resource** and **service-admin**
4. **service-discovery** - Service discovery microservice with [Eureka](https://github.com/mechero/spring-boot-eureka)
5. **service-admin** - Admin panel microservice with [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) as frontend, uses normal cookies as session. For now whole front-end is done with Vaadin server-side components, without any custom styling.
6. **service-gateway** - Gateway microservice using [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway) allows adding new artists, albums, tracks.
7. **service-resource** - Resource microservice, serves content thought REST API to [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) frontend, uses JWT tokens as stateless Authentication. For media files storage project uses [Spring Content](https://paulcwarren.github.io/spring-content/).
8. **service-authentication** - Authentication microservice with JWT tokens, allows registering new users.

## Building project

The easiest way to build project is running 

>gradle jar

then

>docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d --build

docker will take care of everything including database

## Todo list
- Custom gradle task with docker
- Fix docker compose (provide something like Amazon S3 or MongoDB GridFS to share files instead of using raw file system) âœ… partially done
- Tests, tests, tests and more tests...
- Connect admin panel microservice to eureka | Partially done
- Importing artist data from external services like last.fm API
- Use Hashcorp Vault to externalize configuration
- Change password endpoints and email confirmation (possibility to use message broker to load balance mails)
- Debug queries generated by hibernate and optimize them
